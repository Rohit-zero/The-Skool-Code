<h1>Java Terminology</h1><br><!-- comment --><br>
<p>Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these common terms of Java.</p>
<p><b>1.  Java Virtual Machine(JVM):</b>This is generally referred to as JVM. There are three execution phases of a program. They are written,<br>
compile and run the program.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.</li>
    <li>The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes<br><!-- comment -->
    Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.</li>
    <li>In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating<br>
    System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems.<br>
    This is why Java is known as a platform-independent language.<br>
    <br>
    <b>2. Bytecode in the Development process: </b>As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that<br>
    it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.<br>
    <b>3. Java Development Kit(JDK):</b>While we were using the term JDK, when we learn about bytecode and JVM . So, as the name suggests,<br>
    it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers,<br>
    java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java<br>
    program.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE): </b>JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we<br>
    cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.<br>
    <br>
    <b>5. Garbage Collector:</b>In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called<br>
    Garbage Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the of objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer<br>
    easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that<br>
    have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.<br>
    <b>6. ClassPath:</b>The classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By default, JDK<br>
    provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.<br>
    <br>
<h3>Primary/Main Features of Java</h3><br>
    <br>
    <b>1. Platform Independent:</b>Compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the<br>
    compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then<br>
    we can run it on Linux and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same<br>
    after the execution of bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.<br>
    <b>2. Object-Oriented Programming Language:</b>Organizing the program in the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented<br>
    programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.<br>
    <br><!-- comment -->
    <br><!-- comment -->

    <p>The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:</p>
        <ul>
     <li>Abstraction</li>
     <li>Encapsulation</li>
     <li>Inheritance</li>
     <li>Polymorphism</li></ul>   
    <br><!-- comment -->
    <br>
    <b>3. Simple:</b>Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple<br>
    inheritances, Explicit memory allocation. <br>
    <br>
    <b>4. Robust:</b>Java language is robust that means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as<br>
    early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming<br><!-- comment -->
    language. The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation.<br>
    <br>
    <b>5. Secure:</b>In java, we don’t have pointers, and so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows<br>
    In java, we don’t have pointers, and so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows<br>
    impossible to exploit in Java.      <br>
    <br>
    <b> 6. Distributed:</b>We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and<br>
    Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The java programs can be easily distributed on one or more<br>
    systems that are connected to each other through an internet connection.<br>
    <br>
    <b>7. Multithreading:</b>Java supports multithreading. It is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a<br>
    program for maximum utilization of CPU.<br>
    <br>
    <b>8. Portable:</b> As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java<br>
    in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution makes java portable.<br>
